      <h2>About Our Orchestra</h2>
      <p>
        The Bloomingdale music program believes that the study of music and visual
        performance is essential for enhancing a student's longâ€‘term success and
        quality of life. Membership in the program instills commitment,
        teamwork, and integrity, helping to produce future leaders. Once
        students join the Bloomingdale music community, there is a commitment
        to their success that extends well beyond their four years at the
        high school.

        Your support helps provide our orchestra students with the resources they
        need. Contributions fund essentials such as the purchase and repair of
        instruments, acquisition of sheet music and scores, and travel
        opportunities for performances. Together we can ensure that every
        musician has the chance to grow, perform and represent our community
        with pride.
